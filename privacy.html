        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Home Assistant, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>
